This is a simple game that I set up as an exercise to learn
how to create apps with Django that leverage the simplicity of its web framework with Python's calculation and charting power. Most tutorials online teach how to set up simpler apps like blogs that have little business logic under the hood, so this game is my personal laboratory to experiment with these platforms and their integration.

<p>
The Rules are simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>5 companies from the S&amp;P 100 and a date from 2010 to 
2017 are picked at random.</li>
<li> You can see each company's last 6 month price chart, and
their GICS sector + industry.</li>
<li> You must create a portfolio with these 5 companies, choosing
the weights for each one with the slider bar. Weights must add up to
100% and there is no shorting.</li>
<li> After submitting, you will be shown the return this simulated
portfolio would have had during the following 6 months, and the names
of each company.</li>
<li>You can see your return history and growth of a simulated $1,000,000
starting capital in the "Performance Dashboard" tab.</li>
</ul>
