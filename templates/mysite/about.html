<div class="about">
<p>
My name is Cristobal Aguirre. I studied Economics
in Chile, and moved to Vancouver with my wife in mid 2017 after 5 months travelling around South East Asia.
I set up this website as a personal project to learn web app development with the Django
Web Framework.
</p>

<p>
While most of my working experience is
in finance, I am very interested in Data Science and programming in Python. The simplicity of the syntax, its massive online support and resources
like StackOverflow and the thousands of libraries freely available online have allowed the
massification of its use. This is allowing a new breed of analyst to emerge, with a career outside computer science (marketing, law, etc.) but 
with enough understanding of programming to implement technical solutions previously outsourced, discarded as too complicated and, most importantly,
never considered in the first place because no one in the business unit ever thought it possible. How would you consider setting up a web scraper to 
automatically download online data instead of doing it manually if you don't know what that is?
</p>

<p>
Beyond the obvious efficiency gains, the real benefit of having technically capable analysts weaved through an organization is a much faster and
effective reaction to increased business complexity. A worryingly large percentage of business data is currently compiled and analyzed using
Excel spreadsheets, whose low barrier to entry meant access to wide audiences, but at several costs. Leaving aside financial models
that religiously adhere to standars like FAST, most can be described as easy to break, hard to fix and impossible to transfer. Python code can be
more carefully standarized and documented (many managers are skeptic about new technology because it introduces key man risk, so good documentation is
an important point), is more versatile (many spreadsheets cross the breaking point when asked to do tasks beyond their nature) and more capable (a few
simple lines of code using any of the thousand libraries can replace those despicable Excel formulas that are two lines long and impossible to audit).
The main benefit of using spreadsheets -- their mass usage, is also it's main fault; the ease of use invites carelesness, which is very costly down
the line.
</p>

<p>
I strongly believe being closer to the business requirements <strong>and</strong> having a significant participation in the solution development,
as opposed to outsourcing it (either externally or internally), will yield a more scalable and effective product. That is why I'm always searching for
ways to expand my programming knowledge, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Not because I think programming is more fun/more valuable
than accounting or marketing, but because I expect this distinction to disappear in the near future.
