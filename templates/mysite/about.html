    <div id="about">
    My name is Cristobal Aguirre. I studied Economics in Chile, and moved to Vancouver with my
    wife in mid 2017 after 5 months travelling around South East Asia. I set up this website
    as a personal project to practice web app development with the Django Web Framework.

    While most of my working experience is in finance, I am very interested in Data Science
    and programming in Python. The simplicity of the syntax, its massive online support and
    resources like StackOverflow and the thousands of libraries freely available online have
    allowed the massification of its use.

    As a self-taught programmer, I owe a great debt to the open source community, and the people who took the time to write the tutorials and answers I used to learn. I will use this site as a platform to give back to the community as best I can, helping others who run into the same roadblocks I have in the past. And because the best way to get an answer on the internet is not by posting a question but an incorrect answer, I also hope more experienced programmers will chip in and share their experience to everyone's benefit.

    <div id="science">
    I strongly believe being closer to the business requirements and having a significant
    participation in the solution development, as opposed to outsourcing it (either
    externally or internally), will yield a more scalable and effective product. That is
    why I'm always searching for ways to expand my programming knowledge, and encourage
    everyone else to do so as well. Not because I think programming is more fun/more valuable
    than accounting or marketing, but because I expect this distinction to disappear in the
    near future.
