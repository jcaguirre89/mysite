<p id="about">
My name is Cristobal Aguirre. I studied Economics in Chile, and moved to Vancouver with my
wife in mid 2017 after 5 months travelling around South East Asia. I set up this website
as a personal project to learn web app development with the Django Web Framework.

<p id="django">
While most of my working experience is in finance, I am very interested in Data Science
and programming in Python. The simplicity of the syntax, its massive online support and
resources like StackOverflow and the thousands of libraries freely available online have
allowed the massification of its use. This is allowing a new breed of analyst to emerge,
with a career outside computer science (marketing, law, etc.) but with enough understanding
of programming to implement technical solutions previously outsourced, discarded as too
complicated and, most importantly, never considered in the first place because no one in
the business unit ever thought it possible. How would you consider setting up a web scraper
to automatically download online data instead of doing it manually if you don't know what
that is?
</p>

<p id="science">
I strongly believe being closer to the business requirements and having a significant
participation in the solution development, as opposed to outsourcing it (either
externally or internally), will yield a more scalable and effective product. That is
why I'm always searching for ways to expand my programming knowledge, and encourage
everyone else to do so as well. Not because I think programming is more fun/more valuable
than accounting or marketing, but because I expect this distinction to disappear in the
near future.
